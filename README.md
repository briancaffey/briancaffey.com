This is a site I built to test some of the ideas I have been learning in Django. Here as some features:

- Allows users to create accounts and login
- Users can join my monthly newsletter
- Joining newsletter sends an email confirmation link to the entered address if it does not exist
- Confirmation link contains a UID that looks up the email and then saves it as a confirmed email address
- Allows logged in users and anonymous users to sign a guest book
- Guestbook uses AJAX and rest framework
- Uses a simple API to map client IP address to a city and display city name
- Logged-in users can submit suggestions for my reading list and add tags to their suggestions (using Django Taggit)
- Users can post articles to my blog
- Users can search for blog posts
- Users can "like" blog articles
- Users can follow/unfollow other users
- Users can read a project list that describes my recent projects

I used Bootstrap 3 to design the user interface and deployed the site with Heroku.
