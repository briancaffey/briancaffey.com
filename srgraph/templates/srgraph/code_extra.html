<h3>background</h3>
<p>I did this project about 4 months ago, before I learned anything about Django (the python web framework that powers this website). I have become pretty familiar with Django's object-relational mapping (ORM), but this project mostly relies on a NetworkX to calculate the shortest path between two given subreddits out of a pool of about 18,000. This puts the total number of possible unique pairs (where order matters) at 325,000,000. Without any idea of whether or not it would work with a Django app on Heroku, here is the approach I took:</p>

<ol>
  <li>install most of the condas <a href="https://github.com/briancaffey/briancaffey.com/blob/master/requirements.txt">dependencies</a> and <code>pip freeze</code> them into <code>requirements.txt</code>.</li>
  <li>push a 22.9MB <a href="https://github.com/briancaffey/reddit-graph-analysis/blob/master/pickle/master_df.p">pickled data file</a>  containing a large ddictionary (where keys are nodes and values are lists of connections) to my heroku repo.</li>
  <li>set up a <a href="https://github.com/briancaffey/briancaffey.com/blob/master/srgraph/utils.py">utility script</a> that reads in the pickled file and then create an undirected graph from the dictionary.</li>
  <li>call the utility function in my views, and display links to the subreddits that make up the shortest path.</li>
</ol>
<p>here the <code>utils.py</code> file that powers the graph search:</p>
<pre>
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
from .models import Subreddit

master_df = pd.read_pickle('master_df.p')
master_df_ = master_df[master_df.notnull()]

master_df_u = master_df_.drop_duplicates('subreddit')
master_df_u = master_df_u.drop(master_df_u.index[master_df_u.subreddit=='/r/track__subreddits_'])
graph = {x:y for x, y in zip(master_df_u.subreddit, master_df_u.related)}

G=nx.Graph()
G=nx.from_dict_of_lists(graph)
#making the graph undirected takes all of the vertices between nodes and makes them bi-directional
G1 = G.to_undirected()

def path(sr_one, sr_two):
  data = {'one':sr_one, 'two':sr_two}
  if nx.has_path(G1, sr_one, sr_two):
      path = [x+'\n' for x in nx.shortest_path(G1, sr_one, sr_two)]
      data['path'] = path
      collection = list(Subreddit.objects.filter(name__in=path))
      collection.sort(key=lambda t:path.index(t.name))
      data['collection']  = collection
      return data
</pre>
<p>I think the efficiency could be significanlty improved, and things got a little but clumsy when working with both a database of subreddit names and the dictionary/graph. Overall I'm please things are working the way they are. I couldn't find a good answer about whether or not I could store a large pickle file in the Heroku file system, since it is <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem">ephemeral</a>.
