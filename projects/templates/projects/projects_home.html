<p>here is a list of various projects I have done, roughly in reverse chronological order. the projects here mostly cover programming and web development topics, but also includes other fun and interesting tech-related things I've done.</p>

<h2>Jekyll Blog</h2>
<blockquote>
this website is my first portfolio site hosted on Github pages. I wrote a full tutorial on how to set up a Jekyll Blog. The site is static and uses a Ruby-based framework with Github-flavored Markdown.
</blockquote>

<h2>bucksamonth.com</h2>
<blockquote>
One day browsing instagram I came across three interesting ads: a subscription based vegan snack delivery service for $10/month, an A.I. athletic trainer via smartphone for $5/month, and an subscription-based clothing and accessory service for $60/month. subscriptions are a becoming a bigger and bigger part of lives, and they define our interests, hobbies and lifestyles. I set out to create services that helps people track, compare and explore paid subscription services in a fun and social way. bucksamonth.com provides users with an easy way to track and remeber monthly subscription services, write reviews and articles about their subscriptions, and connect with and message other users. this is the first full-feature site I built after completing a number of python tutorials. feel free to try it out if you need help managing your subscriptions.

<h2>PC Part Picker Data</h2>
<blockquote>
This project explores data I scrapped from a popular PC enthusiast website. I make use of some great python packages: pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn. I built predictive models for several types of PC compenents (GPU, motherboard, PSU, etc.) based on their features and generated multi-dimensional data visualizations to better understand the prices of PC components.

<h2>six degrees of subreddits</h2>
<blockquote>
This project uses data I scrapped from 18,000 subreddits to create a "subreddit graphs" where subreddits are nodes and related subreddits form bi-directional edges. Using a python package called NetworkX, I constructed a graph from a python dictionary and put together an applet (hosted on this site) that displays the shortest (or one of the multiple shortest) paths between any two user-selected subreddits. users can also "upvote" interesting or funny results. The project features some slick AJAX and jQuery features such as autocomplete and infinite scroll.
</blockquote>
<h2>classifying 16-state Lagnton Ants</h2>
<blockquote>
This project explores a type of cellular automaton called Langton's Ant. This is one of the first projects I did after completing (several stages) of the Python Challenge (a site that first got me very interesting in learning more about python). the program generates images and/or videos of n-state ants after m steps. the second half of the project uses clustering and outlier-detection (from sci-kit learn) to classify 65,000 ants into similar groups.
</blockquote>

<h2>@tw_tt_r_b_t</h2>
<blockquote>
@tw_tt_r_b_t is a twitter bot hosted on heroku that tweeted a one-dimensional cellular automoton every 5 minutes for the better part of 2016 into March of 2017. After tweeting 94,000 images, I layed @tw_tt_r_b_t to rest to make room for another app on my heroku account.
</blockquote>

<h2>Capital Creative</h2>
<blockquote>
Capital Creative is the name of a web consultancy I have been building over the last two years. I offer websites for a wide variety of clients including lawyers, non-profit groups and real-estate developers. I am also developing standardized solutions for niche community groups that have have low levels of technical skills such as garden clubs and Boy Scout Troops. I build client solutions on the Wix platform and provide clients with a full library of custom and generic video tutorials to help them with all aspects of maintaining and updating their website, and also managing thrid party services used together with their sites. if you or your organizations needs a wesite solution, please get in touch!
</blockquote>

<h2>Monty Hall simulation</h2>
<blockquote>
This are the first few lines of pyhthon I wrote. I was unable to convince my family that the odds of success in the Monty Hall problem improve from 1/3 to 2/3 (on average) if you always change your answer, so I set out to write a simple program to simulate playing the game 100,000 times.
</blockquote>

<h2>Ascension I and Beast Mode II</h2>
<blockquote>
The high-performance PCs I built for me and my cousin in the summer of 2016.
</blockquote>

<h2>Alunar 3D Printer</h2>
<blockquote>
I built the cheapest self-assembled 3D printer avialable on Amazon.
</blockquote>

<h2>SketchUp Designs</h2>
<blockquote>
Some architectural models I put together using Google SketchUp. One for my pre-computer era architect mother, and another for a real-estate developer in Atlanta.
